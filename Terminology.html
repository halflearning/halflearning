                }<br>
               <br> Here value 1, value 2, valuen are the possible values of the given expression.Whatever value of expression is obtained. The control is transferred to the case of the same value and executes the write statement below it. switch is used to deal with multi-way branching. If none of the values match, the option's statement in default is executed.<br>

                <br><b>(363) while statement :-</b>&nbsp; The while statement performs the looping action.<br>
                while (condition) statement :<br>
                As long as the condition remains true, the statement is executed over and over again.Each time the condition is checked before executing the statement. Whenever the condition is false, the control exits the loop.<br>

                <br><b>(364) do-while statement :-</b>&nbsp; The do while statement is a looping statement.<br>
                do statement while (condition);<br> 
                It also executes the statement repeatedly like white until the condition is true and if it is false it comes out of the control loop and proceeds. In do while the condition is checked after the execution of the statement.<br>

                <br><b>(365) for statement :-</b>&nbsp; The for statement is a looping statement.<br>
                for (assignment; condition; expression) statement<br>
                Here the assignment is the statement setting the initial value of the variable in the loop. condition is a logical condition that, if true, is executed repeatedly. expression is an expression designed to increase or decrease the value of a variable.<br>
               <br>example- for (i=0;i<5;i++)<br> 
                printf("%d",i); <br>
                In the for statement, the condition is checked before the execution of the statement.<br>

                <br><b>(369) caller function :-</b>&nbsp; The function which is executing by calling another function is called the caller of that function. It is also called calling function.<br>

                <br><b>(370) Function definition :-</b>&nbsp; In the definition of the function, the code statement of the function, the name of the function, the parameters and the return data type are written, it has two parts. The first line of the definition is called the function header, in which the type of data value being returned by the function, the name of the function and the parameters are written. The part below it is called the function body, in which the statement of the function is written.<br>

                <br><b>(371) return type function :-</b>&nbsp; A function can return a data value to its caller program. that data value The data type (int, float, char, etc.) is the return type of the function, which is required to be written in the function definition and function prototype.<br>

                <br><b>(372) function call :-</b>&nbsp; Calling a function using its name to be executed at some place in another function / program is called function call, such as ch=getchar() in a program; The function called getchart is called in the statement.<br>

                <br><b>(373) Parameters :-</b>&nbsp; Parameters are called variables that are passing a data value to a function or to which a function passes a data value. Parameters are declared in the parameter list of the function's header. Parameters in the caller program are written in the function's call statement.<br>

                <br><b>(374) formal parameter :-</b>&nbsp; Parameters written in the definition of a function are called formal parameters of that function.<br>
                <br> int fun1 (int a, int b)     &nbsp;(here int a, int b, is a formal parameter)
                {<br>

                }<br>

                <br><b>(375) Actual Parameter :-</b>&nbsp; Parameters written in a function call statement are called actual parameters. These are the same as the formal parameters of the function being called in number, type and order. Their value is passed in the relative formal parameter when calling the function.<br>
                <br>sum=fun(x.y);               </b>&nbsp;(here fun and x,y is a actual parameter)<br>

                <br><b>(376) Argument :-</b>&nbsp; The data values being passed to the formal parameter are called arguments.<br>
               <br> x=10;           y=15;<br>

                (Here are the 10 and 15 arguments.)<br>

                <br><b>(377) Local Variable :-</b>&nbsp; The variables and parameters declared in the definition of a function are called its local variables. They are called local variables because they can be accessed only in the same function definition and not in any other function outside it. The variables of the auto storage class are also local variables.<br>
                
                <br><b>(378) function call by value :-</b>&nbsp; When data values of actual parameters are passed to a function while calling it, then such function call is called call by value. Any change in those data values inside the function being called in this method does not take effect outside the function i.e. the values of the actual parameter will remain the same. Example- fun1(2,3); fun2(x.y);<br>

                <br><b>(379) Function call by reference :-</b>&nbsp; It is also called 'call' by 'address'. While calling the function with this method, instead of the value of the actual parameter, the address of the actual parameter is passed, due to which there is a change in the value stored on that address as a result of the action performed inside the called function i.e. the actual function of the caller function.The values of the parameters are changed. Example- fun1 (&x,&y);<br>

                <br><b>(380) Command line argument / parameter :-</b>&nbsp; The values of the parameters are changed. Example- fun1 (&x,&y); Parameter arguments can be passed from the operating system to the main() function of 'C' programs, which are called command line parameters. These can be passed while running the program by writing along with the name of the program. main() has two formal command line parameters. arge This is an int, which contains the number of elements being passed. argv[ ] This is an array of string pointer type with a parameter stored at one location (except for *argv[0] ).<br>

                <br><b>(381) Automatic Variables :-</b>&nbsp; The variables of the auto storage class are called automatic variables. Their scope in the program is limited only to the function in which they are declared. Local variables and formal parameters of a function are auto variables.<br>

                <br><b>(382) External Variables :-</b>&nbsp; Variables in the extern storage class are external variables. inside the function Declared by using the extern keyword.<br>
                <b><center>extern variablename;</center></b>
                Ordinary variables defined outside a function definition are also external variables, their scope extends to all functions that are defined after those variables. All functions written after their definition to external variables External variables can be accessed in all functions written after their definition.<br>
                <br>.................. <br> 
                intx; external variable<br>

                <br><b>(383) Array :-</b>&nbsp; An element 'C' which is a set of multiple data storage locations. A data item can be stored independently in each of its locations. The array is known as an identifier. An array can store only one type of data item.<br>

                <br><b>(384) Array Element :-</b>&nbsp; A location of an array is called its array element. An array element can be accessed and processed just like a variable. The array element can be accessed by the name of the array and its index numberin the index number of the th array element is -1. If x is an array then its n and array elements can be accessed from x[n-1] .<br>

                <br><b>(385) 1-Dimensional Array :-</b>&nbsp; 1- Dimensional array has only one row of many columns. this many arrays is a sorted row whose each array element is separated by only one index digit.<br>
